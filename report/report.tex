\section{Problem Statement}

\section{General Assumptions and Methodology}
All drawn diagrams were drawn using \url{http://draw.io/} and charts were made with Microsoft Excel 2013.\\ All results were calculated as an average of running the same experiment three times and calculating the average result.\\

\noindent The system used for empirical analysis, has an Intel i7 4770 Ivy-bridge CPU, with eight processing units, and 8GB of RAM. The GPU used was a GTX 750ti with 2048MB global memory and computer capability 5.0\\

\noindent For every batch run of experiments (for all 5 implementations) a random square image and a random square kernel were produced. The dimensions of the image went up from 500 pixels to 3000 in increments of 500. The kernel dimensions were tested at 3x3, 5x5, and 7x7. Each specific setup was performed 3 times and the averages of the results were then taken.

\section*{Acknowledgements}
I made use of the CUDA 8.0 SDK and its associated images and sample programs. I also used many of the standard libraries which come with c++. I also used the lab examples from class as a way to figure out how to implement CUDA.
